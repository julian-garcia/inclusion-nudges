Hi, I'm Lisa Kepinski. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Co-founder and co-author of the global non profit initiative

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
called Inclusion Nudges.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I'm Tinna Nielsen and I'm the other co-author

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and co-founder.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So we came together in 2013,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we were internal practitioners of inclusion and diversity

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we realised that the work was in a repetitive pattern.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Not only in our own experiences but with others getting stuck

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we were focused on how to unstick it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yes, and I think what is common for both of us in that line of work

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
was that we were experimenting with applying behavioural insights

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and designing these interventions because it was sometimes like pushing water uphill,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
it was too hard as a change maker to do this on your own.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So it was about engaging people but in a way where they could see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and feel the need to do something different in terms of inclusion & diversity.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And when we came together and we actually shared some of the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
very practical interventions we had designed, a very interesting pattern emerged

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and I think that was really an epiphany moment for us.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We saw a pattern - there are three different types of interventions

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that we had designed. And when we started discussing those

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we could actually frame it up and we could see a pattern that was

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
something we could communicate to others.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And now it started becoming interesting because everybody was asking:

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What are you actually doing that seems to be working?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And now it became easier for us to actually communicate it because

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we could set up a theme around it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And so out of this work, what we're focused on is trying to steer behaviour

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to be more closely aligned to our intentions which, in this case,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we're focused on increasing inclusion inside organisations and societies worldwide.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So the global inclusion nudges initiative is a platform for bringing people together

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
who are working on increasing inclusion and sharing what works.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So we invite you to be part of this initiative.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And please visit inclusion-nudges.org to learn more

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
as well as to share your examples of interventions to increase inclusion

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that are based on behavioural insights.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I think that's it! Thank You
