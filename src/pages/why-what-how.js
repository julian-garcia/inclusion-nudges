      <p>Written by Tinna C. Nielsen and Lisa Kepinski</p>
      <p>We are the Founders of the Inclusion Nudges Global Initiative and the originators of the Inclusion Nudges change approach and concept which began in 2013. In this article, we share with you why and how we can all be a part of re-designing our organisations, communities, and society to make inclusion the default and norm by applying Inclusion Nudges in each of our spheres of influence.</p>
      <h2>Why nudging for inclusion is a must</h2>
      <p>We see and feel that the world around us is changing. We hear that the pace and scale of the changes are bigger than ever. Like us, you might also have a hard time grasping the full implications of this. What does the future hold? How will the current Fourth Industrial Revolution change our lives? How will The Great Reset of societal and economic inequities include us? How will we collectively reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for peace prosperity? How will we achieve inclusive growth? How will I continue to live and work with meaning, purpose, and progress? Against these questions and uncertainty of what the future will be, perhaps you’ve also noticed changes in your part of the world? Maybe you’ve experienced how diversity, such as demographics, cultures, and knowledge, continues to increase and change our workplaces and communities? </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-1" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>Our challenge against all of this is that we must be able to interact and make decisions in an increasingly complex environment. But complexity puts a toll on our ability to collaborate in ways that embrace and leverage all forms of diversity. And often, even with the best of intentions, we do not succeed as we would like. This happens even when we know that using the potential of diversity is a necessity.</p>
      <p>Diversity is a reality and there’s no way around it. We need it. </p>
      <p>This includes the diverse experiences, perspectives, and knowledge that are available in organisations, teams, schools, cities, communities, and society. To remain agile and innovative, we need to make sure we can successfully leverage this diversity. Only then can we put into play our full potential and the resources of all people. However, this is about much more than leveraging the full potential of people to perform and innovate well. This is about the well-being and health of the billions of people living in our communities and working in our organisations. </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>New solutions are needed to create a socially, culturally, environmentally, and economically sustainable and inclusive world.</p>
      <p>This means that inclusive collaboration, development, hiring, idea-generation, decision-making, cultures, and behaviours are the means to achieve inclusive outcomes.</p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>That’s why we have set out on a global mission of leveraging the diverse human potential of everyone to co-create inclusive organisations, communities, and societies.</p>
      <p>Making inclusion the default and norm everywhere, for everyone is a MUST! We all have a role in making this happen. But we have a problem and an absurd dilemma because the human mind is not working with us on this, but instead it is more against us. Let’s take a look at how. </p>
      <h2>Absurd impossibility, or an absurd reality?</h2>
      <p>Imagine a group of leaders discussing a pool of qualified people for a senior management position. They just interviewed them and one of the leaders says, </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>“The best qualified candidate is definitely the tallest of them. No doubt.<br/> Tall leaders are the best at executing strategy. <br/> Tall people have the most presence and are most resilient in tough times. <br/> They are the best leaders.”</p>
      <p>They know they made the best choice about the best candidate for that l position. No doubt in their mind.</p>
      <h3 className="colour-accent-1">But which mind? </h3>
      <p>That is potentially the most important question you should be asking yourself because this is what is at the core of what we need to change.</p>
      <p>Surely, no leaders who have the intention to hire the best qualified candidate, who perceive themselves to be a professional leader, and who know the cost of a recruitment process and the cost of hiring the wrong candidate, would rationally believe and consciously argue that tall people are the best leaders because they are tall. No, we wouldn’t. We don’t do that with our conscious and rational mind. </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-4" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>So, the above scenario is absolutely absurd. But the catch is that we do this with our unconscious and instinctive mind, and thus, also in our behaviours and decisions. </p>
      <p>In judgement and decision making, there is often a gap between our rational knowledge and our unconscious doing. In the example of leaders-height effect, this means that even when a hiring manager, HR professional, and citizen know that being tall does not guarantee you are a good leader, they still make a judgement and choice in their unconscious mind as if it did.</p>
      <p>Evidence from around the world and a wide body of research have proven over and over that height influences more heavily in decisions about leaders than their merit. This is a reality resulting in a population of top leaders where 60% of them are at or above 185 cm (6 ft 1 in) tall. On its own, perhaps this fact may not seem so absurd to you. But when compared to the general population, the irrationality emerges when knowing that only 14% of people have that height. This height-leadership effect is also seen in greater high-status opportunities available to tall people, with more promotions, and higher incomes. Tall leaders’ average earnings are 15% more than shorter leaders.  A large majority (86% of one survey’s respondents) believe that height is an advantage in the workplace. The height-leadership effect is not just for business leaders. It also holds true for political leaders in countries around the world. The heights are reflective of national averages, but the effect holds consistent. Tall leaders are the normative pattern. Local cultures do not mitigate this effect.</p>
      <p>This happens because the unconscious mind has an instinctive and intuitive reaction based on associations (connections) between ‘tall’ and ‘leader’ and certain traits, such as ‘strong’, ‘presence’, ‘powerful’ and ‘capable’. These characteristics make our unconscious mind believe that the tallest person is the best leader. Once that belief is activated, the rational mind searches for the evidence to prove it. This is when we become blind to the facts and merits that other people (who are not tall) could be better leaders. We make flawed judgements and conclusions. And we are blind to this.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at another example.</p>
      <h2>Absurd impossibility, or an absurd reality?</h2>
      <p>Have you ever met a leader or project manager saying, </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> “I always make sure to waste the talent of the people in my team by facilitating meetings and idea-generation in ways that make them all think the same and shut up. Diversity is a waste of time and critical thinking a pain!” </p>
      <p>We haven’t! But we have seen behaviours that results in this reality playing out again and again. Unfortunately, it’s the norm that most meetings, group sessions, idea-generation, decision-making, and product or strategy development are facilitated in ways that lead to the waste of diverse human talent and collective potential of the group. And this happens without intention. As a matter of fact, the intention is mostly the opposite. </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-2" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>Many apply a ‘just speak up’ approach of encouraging people to engage and contribute and get access to the diversity of skills and perspectives of people. While the intentions are good, this has many hidden barriers. It is simply not enough to tell people to speak up because of invisible and unintentional group dynamics, formal and informal power, status and roles in a group, self-silencing, and much more.</p>
      <p>Evidence from a wide body of research has proven over and over that group dynamics, such as group conformity, influence heavily in collaboration and decision-making. Experiments on conformity show that group dynamics are a powerful force that makes two-thirds of people (on average) conform to the opinion of the majority. As social beings we have an innate, basic need to be and feel accepted by the group. We conform unconsciously – and sometimes consciously. We conform out of fear for social sanctioning, punishment, and have concern for our reputation. We conform because we are afraid of being perceived as incompetent or because we believe that what the majority of peers think must be right. This means that we don’t disclose and share information or opinions that depart from the group’s inclination. With the best of intentions to be inclusive, it can easily become a case of the loudest gets heard, it favours people with communication styles that match the cultural norms (extrovert), and those with most power and status, members of the majority. These factors can result in less input and making it easier to remain silent and go along with a view already expressed. All of this limits access to the diversity of perspective that is so crucial in task solving, innovation, and decision making.</p>
      <p>Surely, no leaders who perceive themselves to be a professional leader, who have put together a team or group of great people to solve shared tasks and challenges, or develop a new strategy, service, or product, or make good decisions, would have a deliberate intention to waste the skills, know-how, passion, knowledge, or ideas of all these people. Nor would any leaders, with their conscious and rational mind, believe that making people shut up, stop thinking as individuals, and diminish their ability to use critical thinking, is the best way to achieve creativity, innovation, engagement, and great new solutions.</p>
      <p className="colour-accent-2" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>We tend to believe that if we encourage people to share their views and beliefs candidly, then they will do so. Most of us genuinely believe we are independent individuals who will speak up even if the majority of others in the group have a different view that us.  But we tend not to.</p> 
      <p>Speaking up in plenary can be a vulnerable situation for many people and especially when having a point of view that differs from that of the majority. Even when we know in our rational mind that speaking first does not make someone more right than the others in a group, nor does the fact that the majority quickly agrees on something make them more right. Yet, we still behave as if it does when we conform and self-silence.</p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>So, what may seem like an absurd impossibility, is actually an absurd reality. When left unaddressed, it gets replicated time and time again in our organisations and communities – without any intentions whatsoever.</p>
      <p>And it becomes our established, and unseen, normative way of behaving. We are all susceptible to making this happening, exactly because of how our human mind works. No one wants this to happen, so why does it? </p>
      <h2>Important insights about the human mind</h2>
      <p>Though we like to believe we are rational thinkers, who would make the needed changes according to the evidence showing us all the benefits we can achieve from inclusion and diversity, the reality is that we are not rational. Why is that?</p>
      <p className="colour-accent-1" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>There is a gap between our intentions and actions because there is a gap between the two interdependent modes of thinking in our mind.</p>
      <p>Researchers estimate that as much as 90-99% of our thought processes, choices, and behaviours occur automatically in our subconscious brain. While the subconscious brain evolved to ensure our survival and keep us safe, it also holds us back from being objective and inclusive. The brain receives more than 11 million bits of information at any given moment through all our senses.</p>
      <p className="colour-accent-3" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>Our mind uses mental shortcuts, such as associations (perceive connection between elements or input) and biases (errors in processing and interpreting information or stimuli) to make judgements, to process, to make sense, to make choices, and to act.</p>
      <p> These mental mechanisms and shortcuts enable our functioning to occur without using a lot of energy on interpretations and complex evaluations. Our reactions to the information and stimuli are effortless and automatic in the unconscious mind. In most cases, this works well, but in many other cases, errors in judgment and choices are made due to our split-second associations and biases, such as tall equals strong leader or speaking first equals being right. And when faced with situations requiring mental effort due to ambiguity, complexity, and time-pressure, we rely even more on mental shortcuts. These unreflective mental processes trigger thoughts, decisions, and behaviours in both negative and positive ways towards people, ideas, situations, language, objects, solutions, and more. If we have positive associations, we are more likely to process more of the information a person shares with us, or like their idea better, than when negative associations are triggered. This will influence if we include or exclude people, information, and ideas. This is not registered in the conscious, reflective mind. Thus, we behave or make choices that are against our own intentions, knowledge, and values. We are often blind to this gap. </p>
      <p> In summary, our <strong>automatic system 1</strong> thinking is characterized as unconscious and fast, instinctive, effortless, associative, uncontrolled, and powerful. It is like an auto pilot. It dominates the majority of our behaviours and choices. While the <strong>reflective system 2</strong> thinking is defined as conscious and slow, effortful, deductive, logical, self-aware, rule-following, and controlled.  All people use these two modes of thinking at all times —the rational reflective and the irrational unconsciously biased. These are universal across all human beings.</p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> These two inter-connected cognitive systems are at the centre of our challenges with leveraging human talent and the full potential of our diversity. The gap is a perpetuation of the many absurd realities in our lives and work.</p>
      <p> When it comes to issues such as inclusion, diversity and equality this gap means that even when we know how important it is, we rationally understand the evidence for all the benefits we can achieve as organisations, businesses, communities, cities, and society, we are explicit about our support, and we perceive ourselves as being a fair and inclusive person, we nevertheless still in our actions do the opposite. And without even knowing or realising this. This is the core of the challenges that we need to address.</p>
      <p> Perhaps you might be thinking, “Surely, we humans are evolving and getting smarter.” </p>
      <p> But that’s not the case. A body of research shows that rather than diminishing, the power of the unconscious mind is actually increasing due to cognitive overload as a result of increased complexity and social media echo-chambers of homogeneity, and increasingly busy and stressed lives. All of which intensifies our need for mental shortcuts and effortless judgment and choices. This results in greater homogeneity and exclusion at the expense of our collective need for inclusion of diversity. </p>
      <h2> Awareness is not the solution – it might backlash </h2>
      <p> Knowing in the rational, conscious mind about bias and group dynamics, and having good intentions does not reduce the impact of the unconscious mind, nor does it make people act accordingly with this knowledge. This means that as change makers, our efforts are not going to work when trying to convince people to be more inclusive and make them aware of their unconscious biases, stereotypes, and need to fit in. </p>
      <p> Unfortunately, this is a common approach across the world. This has also resulted in a global trend of focusing on unconscious bias awareness training as the solution. While this multi-billion dollar-a-year industry is profiting from many thinking this approach will fix the problem, the outcomes of this are ineffective. Research and real experiences are showing that unconscious bias awareness training can even backfire because it unintentionally enhances more biased thinking and behaviours, as well as strengthen stereotypes. </p>
      <p>Also, by hearing that others are biased and its ‘natural’ to hold stereotypes, we feel less motivated to change biases or worse, attending such training can create a self-perception of having control of ones’ biases and being one of the ‘good people’ not discriminating. This has proven to trigger a so-called moral licensing, which makes our behaviour not only non-inclusive, but the very opposite of our stated values, beliefs, and intentions. Moral licensing is an unconscious mental phenomenon in which a positive self-image makes our unconscious mind more likely to make immoral choices. Studies have shown that people who have expressed strong disagreement with sexist statements are more likely to hire a man for a job and make sexist comments because they feel secure about their ‘non-sexist’ self-image. People who express disagreement with racist statements have also been shown to be more likely to unconsciously discriminate against racial minorities.</p>
      <p className="colour-accent-2" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> This might sound absurd. Moral licensing is absurd. Your first reaction might be, “I don’t do that!”. But the evidence is so conclusive that it is more absurd to believe we are exempt from having the same cognitive mechanisms as everyone else. </p>
      <p> This global trend is an expression of hope that the unconscious bias training sessions will somehow ‘fix’ our biased thinking, interactions, and processes. We do acknowledge that such sessions can create a shared experience and aha-moments, and thus create a shared language that can ease conversations about root causes that needs to be addressed in the organisation or community. But these types of awareness trainings are not the magic solution for promoting more inclusiveness and leveraging the diversity of all talents. Also, many people hold a misconception about bias—that it is something found in others and seen in their actions, but not in ourselves. This bias blind spot is a common gap in all people—it’s harder to see our own patterns and also to admit that we are biased. </p>
      <p> Awareness, willpower, and knowledge are simply not sufficient for impactful behavioural and organisational change. These are speaking to the wrong system of the brain—system 2. But our actions are overwhelmingly in our system 1. We must speak to the ‘doing’ (system 1) part of our brain. So how can we do this? </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-4" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>We can work with our inter-dependent cognitive systems by changing the barriers of the mind into strengths.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look at how we can make this happen by using the power of Inclusion Nudges. These make a profound difference in combatting biases and absurd realities. </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> Awareness is not the solution. <br/> Mitigating the influence of unconscious bias is, <br/> and this requires that we design ways out of the problem.</p>
      <h2>Design for inclusion as the new default and norm</h2>
      <p> We assume that you are involved with or interested in driving change in organisations, communities, or society in a more inclusive and fair direction. We also assume that means that you, like us, have had the experience of moving three steps forward and then one step back, or have felt the frustration of seeing change moving forward only to find out later that many people have reverted to default behaviour. We also assume that you are concerned about how to get many people to move in the same direction towards more inclusive behaviour, leadership, collaboration, decision-making, development, and culture – while at the same time allowing them to get there in as many different ways as there are people in the organisation. </p>
      <p> Like us, some of you might have found that the change efforts for inclusion, diversity, equality, gender parity, human rights, anti-discrimination and much more, didn’t pay off as fast or as much as hoped for or anticipated. For sure, this was the case for us in our roles as internal change makers in multinational corporations. We have felt the frustrations, disappointment, and pain in feeling that we were not making progress as we had hoped. And turns out we were not alone. Across our wide global networks, we heard similar experiences from our peers in other organisations. We knew a new solution was needed! </p>
      <p> This led us to experimenting over the years as leaders and change makers with applying insights from the science of behavioural economics, nudging, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, neuroscience, and complex system and microeconomic theory. We found this to make a crucial difference for impact. </p>
      <p> Behavioural economics and nudge theory targets the false assumption that almost all people, nearly all of the time, make choices and act in ways that are in their own best interest or the best interest of the groups and society that they are part of. But, this is not the case. We are not rational. The majority of what we do happens in the unconscious and irrational mind. Therefore, designing the environment and processes in which people make choices is necessary to influence people to act in a predictable way and direction that is in alignment with their intentions and self-interest. This is done by designing a nudge that steers people to make better choices, and ‘pushes’ the unconscious mind in a non-intrusive way to change behaviour without taking away the freedom to choose something else. </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> Designing for inclusion is a must. <br/> We cannot wait for people to think it's a good idea. <br/> We need to enable and empower as many people as possible to do inclusion automatically. </p>
      <p> We need to design systems, processes, cultures, technologies, policies, environments, and cities based on behavioural insights to foster inclusive behaviour, interactions, and decision making. This is the purpose of the Inclusion Nudges change approach. </p>
      <h2> What's the Inclusion Nudges change approach </h2>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> Inclusion Nudges are behavioural designs to debias and enhance inclusive collaboration, leadership, development, and decisions. </p>
      <p> An Inclusion Nudge is designed based on insights from behavioural and social sciences to steer the unconscious mind to change behaviour in direction of inclusiveness by targeting the behavioural drivers, judgment and choice processes, and perceptions in the unconscious mind. </p>
      <p> The Inclusion Nudges <strong>change approach</strong> has three purposes and thus, <strong>three types of designed actions</strong> that work – sometimes separately and sometimes together. These are described below. </p>
      <p style={{marginLeft:'2rem'}}> <strong>Motivational actions:</strong> You visualise the hidden patterns and the implications of these both to yourself and to others to create motivation in the unconscious mind to be inclusive. You can get many people engaged in creating the changes without having to tell them to or convince them. Research has proven again and again that change happens when we see and feel the need for change (in the unconscious mind) and not when we rationally understand the need for change. We call these <i>Feel the Need</i> Inclusion Nudges. </p>
      <p style={{marginLeft:'2rem'}}><strong>Process actions:</strong> You can design processes to ensure the ability in yourself and in others to be and do inclusion automatically in daily actions. Research has identified that change comes from making it effortless to do the new behaviour. That’s why it’s crucial and effective to design processes (meeting facilitation, decision making, idea generation, innovation, promotions, hiring, strategy planning, and more) in ways that reduce the negative influence of bias and are inclusive of diverse perspectives by default. This is an effective way to engage people in making the culture in teams, communities, and organisations inclusive as the norm. We call these <i>Process Design</i> Inclusion Nudges.</p>
      <p style={{marginLeft:'2rem'}}><strong>Framing actions:</strong> You can change your own perceptions and split-second judgements, as well as those of other people by the words you use, the way you communicate, how you present a problem, issue, task, or set up the physical space. A body of research shows how our perceptions are influenced by hidden cues that trigger associations in our unconscious mind. When you change the cues, you can prime action, and change perceptions of diversity as a ‘burden’ to be a ‘resource’, you can mitigate and change negative stereotypes, perceptions, and also increase individual performance. We call these <i>Framing Perceptions</i> Inclusion Nudges.</p>
      <p>Inclusion Nudges help the brain change behaviour and close the intentions-actions gap by addressing the implicit norms in our cultures and systems.</p>
      <p className="colour-accent-1" style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>Nudging for inclusion is about making it easy to do inclusion as the norm, without the need of convincing with rational arguments, threats, or punishments nor requiring effortful, conscious thinking.</p> 
      <p> In Lisa's and Tinna's work with many communities, organisations, teams, leaders, and individuals worldwide, we have seen first-hand how this approach of applying behavioural insights and designs for inclusivity makes it so much easier to be an impactful change agent and keep your own motivating force intact, as you co-create changes with ‘the people it’s about’ to make impactful change that stick. </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>With Inclusion Nudges, we can all make inclusion the default and norm<br/>—everywhere, for everyone.</p>
      <h2> How you can make inclusion the norm </h2>
      <p> The need for fundamentally changing how we make inclusive changes for inclusive outcomes has perhaps never been greater. Being inclusive in our actions is easier said than done. That why the mission of the Inclusion Nudges global initiative and community is to </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}>Empower you to apply Inclusion Nudges to engage all people in making systems, cultures, and behaviours inclusive as the norm everywhere, for everyone.</p>
      <p>So first, let’s be clear on what we mean by diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.  Here’s how we define the terms.</p>
      <h2>The definitions we use</h2>
      <div className="bordered-section" style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
        <h3>Diversity: The Mix of All of Us</h3>
        <p> Diversity is about people. This includes their demographic differences, backgrounds, multiple identities, and their unique experiences, perspectives, knowledge, abilities, ideas, and more. Diversity is not referencing specific characteristics of only ‘the minority’ within a group of people or in society. Diversity is referencing all people and differences among us. Diversity is the mix of all of us. </p>
        <h3>Equity: The Fairness Frame for the Mix</h3>
        <p> Equity is about ensuring that all people have equal access to opportunities and fair treatment, and ensuring elimination of discriminatory practices, systems, laws, policies, social norms, and cultural traditions. Equity encompasses a balancing of power and correcting where inequality exists. It is also about patterns of behaviour and processes developed and used which may be continuing inequality. Within some contexts, equity may have a legal mandate attached to achieving it, along with penalties for not. The intent of equity is fairness to all. </p>
        <h3>Inclusion: Welcoming and Applying the Mix</h3>
        <p> Inclusion is focused on fostering the structure, system, processes, culture, behaviour, and mindset that embrace and respect all people and all our diversity. It embraces all people. Inclusion is about ensuring that diversity of knowledge, perspectives, information, and ideas are welcomed & being used. Inclusion is when we seek out diversity, when we challenge excluding norms and stereotypes, when we are open to others, and when we speak up.  Inclusion is when all people are valued and able to participate and contribute to their fullest. Inclusion is welcoming and applying the mix of all of us. </p>
        <h3>Belonging: I Feel Valued as a Part of the Mix</h3>
        <p> Belonging focuses on the person’s experience within a setting—they are welcomed, structures exist to ensure fairness, and they feel that they can be their full, authentic self within that culture, group, or setting. They don’t have to cover who they are or downplay personal traits. As a result, they don’t suffer the limiting toll this can bring. Belonging is when people feel seen and heard, feel they naturally belong to a group, feel safe, and feel valued. This results from having equitable and inclusive practices, norms, cultures, and systems. When diversity, equity, and inclusion are done well, then belonging results. </p>
      </div>
      <h2> The inclusive model—an overview of what you can do </h2>
      <p> We all can struggle to understand what can be done to be more inclusive. Having examples of specific behaviours helps to spark action taking. To set the guiding frame, here is a model that we’ve created based on decades of working with leaders, practitioners, change makers, organisations, and communities, and being leaders and global change agents ourselves. It gives an overview of the many components of inclusive actions.  This is what people can do to be inclusive.</p>
      <p style={{margin:'0'}}><span className="big-1st-letter">I</span><span className="rest">Include people, information, ideas, & knowledge instead of exclude</span></p>
      <p style={{margin:'0'}}><span className="big-1st-letter">N</span><span className="rest">Nurture & embrace differences with empathy instead of polarising</span></p>

      <h2 style={{marginTop:'3rem'}}>Three examples of the three types of Inclusion Nudges</h2>
      <p>Here are three examples of Inclusion Nudges, across the three types, to give you inspiration to get started.</p>
      <h3>Feel the Need Inclusion Nudges</h3>
      <p>Use these to motivate people to change behaviour and engage groups of people in making profound change for inclusiveness by making the brain's unconscious system feel the need for change. These are designed to show the implications of bias rather than tell people that they are biased. These designs make the invisible patterns visible and make people feel the need to change the status quo.</p>
      <div className="bordered-section">
        <img src={NudgeImg} alt="" />
        <h3>Seeing those not seen <br/>and sponsoring them</h3>
        <p>Show with visuals what leaders don't see. Create two visual views with small pictures of the leadership pipeline (top talents), one visual with all the top talents and one with only the women.</p>
        <p>Show the first visual.</p>
        <p>Ask the executives to call out the names of the people they know. Then, show the other visual with the pictures of only women.</p>
        <p>Ask them to call out the names of the people they know.</p>
        <p>Ask them if they notice a pattern.</p>
        <p style={{textAlign:'left'}}><strong>Purpose:</strong> Show that many people are not seen for their performance, and that there was not gender equality in the senior executives' formal & informal networks. Reduce the leaders resistance on the need for greater visibility of women talents through a sponsorship program. Increase their buy-in for the sponsorship program by realising the limited gender equality in their networks. By calling out the names of a lot of men, but only a few names for the second visual of the women, they felt the need for a change.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Process Design Inclusion Nudges</h3>
      <p>Use these to make it easy for people to do inclusiveness by designing processes, systems, and the environment. Ability and simplicity are key. This is about empowering and enabling as many people as possible to do inclusiveness automatically without reflection. These designs mitigate bias, and help people make better judgments and decisions and be more inclusive in ways of working and collaborating as the default.</p>
      <div className="bordered-section">
        <img src={NudgeImg} alt="" />
        <h3>Share with a peer <br/>to access diversity in groups</h3>
        <p>Each member in the group shares their perspective with one other person (peer) in the group.</p>
        <p>They, then, share each other's perspectives to the larger group in plenary.</p>
        <p style={{textAlign:'left'}}><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensure all people feel safe to share their perspective (this intervention does require a level of trust in the group), ensure that individuals do not conform to the view of the majority of group members, and ensure that communication misunderstandings are captured and corrected.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Framing Perceptions Inclusion Nudges</h3>
      <p>Use these to help our unconscious mind perceive issues related to inclusion, diversity, gender parity, equality, and human rights as meaningful. These aim at changing the narratives, discourses, and stereotypes that influence our behaviour towards others. By flipping perceptions, priming specific associations, appealing to identity, altering the frame, or changing the anchor of the thought process, we can frame perceptions to increase inclusion as the norm.</p>
      <div className="bordered-section">
        <img src={NudgeImg} alt="" />
        <h3>Show the hidden people <br/>by reversing the numbers</h3>
        <p>Re-frame the perception by reversing the numbers to show the hidden facts.</p>
        <p>Ask the leaders: “How many people are working here?” <br/>Ask: “How many is 35 % out of the total number of employees?”</p>
        <p>Then say: <br/> “If 65 % feel empowered and growing, then 22,000 (35 %) of your employees do NOT feel empowered and do not have opportunities to grow. That is a lot of talent to miss out on!”</p>
        <p style={{textAlign:'left'}}><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reverse the numbers to change perceptions to see the full picture and see the hidden people behind the numbers and also the consequences.</p>
      </div>
      <p> You can easily make inclusion the norm by applying these types of inclusive behavioural designs in your daily actions. All action matters, both in our own ‘local’ context and collectively in a ‘global’ context. With Inclusion Nudges you can make everyday experimentation and make this happen without having to feel it as a burden, and instead make it a natural and integrated part of your daily work, interactions, and decisions. </p>
      <p> We need to keep inspiring and empowering each other to make it happen. That’s why reciprocal sharing of practical actions proven to work for more inclusivity is important. It is why we founded this movement </p>
      <h2> How the Inclusion Nudges Global Initiative and Community works </h2> 
      <p> Inclusion Nudges is more than a change approach, it is also a global initiative and community. It is a change initiative built on a very simple idea and principles. </p>
      <h3> Sharing </h3>
      <p> This initiative is based on collaboration, co-creation, and sharing to enable and empower other change makers. Sharing with the founders Lisa and Tinna how you have designed inclusive cultures, processes, and behaviour based on behavioural design and Inclusion Nudges, is the foundation of this initiative. As behavioural designers and inclusion experts they write up all examples step by step, and add the behavioural insights explaining why it works. The sharing happens through guidebooks and bespoke support. This is the foundation for improving progress, pace, and scale of the changes we need. </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-1" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}> Your insights and experiences are needed. </p>
      <h3> Reciprocity </h3>
      <p> You can make social change happening by joining forces. Receiving examples and giving examples to others are important to enable as many people as possible to make inclusion the norm. You can do this by exchanging examples of Inclusion Nudges, offering support to each other, and sharing with people in your network that these resources exists for the greater good of all. These are all vital ways to keep this movement of change going. </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-2" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}> You are at the centre of this. </p>
      <h3> Open source </h3>
      <p> The Inclusion Nudges initiative is for everybody. It is for those who want to use the examples being shared, those who design without applying, and those doing both. And it is for those curious and want to learn more. We all need ideas for what can work, and to be able to easily access this. This is why we didn’t copyright the concept or approach. We share under the Creative Commons License. Knowledge shouldn’t be hoarded to one’s self or for sale to a select few, but shared with all in the world. This is how social change can happen. </p>
      <p className="colour-accent-4" style={{fontWeight:'bold'}}> You make it happen. </p>
      <p style={{fontWeight:'bold',textAlign:'center'}}> We invite you to become a part of the global initiative and community. <br/>Let’s join forces! </p>
