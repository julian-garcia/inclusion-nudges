### Title

This Quick Guide navigates you as you apply Inclusion Nudges to de-bias and change your organisations, communities, and society to be inclusive as the default and the norm. The Inclusion Nudges Guidebook, 3rd edition, by Lisa Kepinski & Tinna C. Nielsen, is your go to resource with over 100 howto examples that are based on behavioural science. These have been designed and applied by the authors and others in their work as change makers to lessen the influence of bias, increase inclusivity, ensure equality, and leverage the diversity of all of us.

If you have read the 2nd edition of the guidebook (2016), youâ€™ll be pleased to know there are 57 new examples of Inclusion Nudges, and all the examples from the previous version have been updated with new design variations and behavioural insights. A new feature is more designs for virtual working.
