**What do we mean?**

Recently, I saw a news story[^1] about a trade agreement meeting. The
newscaster introduced the segment by saying, "*Ministers met virtually,
...* \[the reporter took a pause\] *... uhhh ummm, I mean they met, to
discuss*...". This exactly captures a dilemma that many of us are facing
right now as globally large numbers of people are working from home due
to the pandemic. How do we *call* this new way of working?

**How we were working**

Well, this was an issue even before the pandemic. Estimates were that in
many countries over
[60%](https://www.polycom.com/company/news/press-releases/2017/20170321.html)
of knowledge workers were doing work outside of their offices or working
apart from their manager and team. This was either as a formalised,
full-time way of working or informally occasionally doing this. The
[average person](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics)
working this way was male, university educated, 45 years or older,
earning a good salary, and working in a large [private sector](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/working-from-home-coronavirus-workers-future-of-work/)
organisation. Despite over [80%](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics) of
employees expressing a wish to work this way, it remained a privilege
for just a small segment of only [7% of workers](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/working-from-home-coronavirus-workers-future-of-work/).

Pre-pandemic there was recognition that this way of working would be
increasing. A few years back, executives
[predicted](https://www.fastcompany.com/3034286/will-half-of-people-be-working-remotely-by-2020)
that the majority of their workforce would be working outside of the
office by 2020. That indeed came true but not by leadership or workplace
design, but by completely unforeseen circumstances. While leaders and HR
saw flexible work designs as a way to attract and retain a diversity of
talents, it was still not the way most people worked. Still numerous
studies pointed to [financial
savings](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/does-working-remotely-save-you-money/),
increased
[retention](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/productive-working-remotely-top-companies-hiring/),
positive [climate

and [increased
productivity](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/new-study-reveals-why-working-from-home-makes-workers-more-productive.html)
by working outside of the office. But this knowledge did not radically
transform workplaces. Working from home or in other locations outside
the workplace was not the norm, in spite of all the perceived benefits.

In a global
[study](https://centreforglobalinclusion.org/working-from-home/) that I
co-conducted in 2019, we received survey responses from over 4000 people
in 89 countries about where and how they work. One of the main findings
was that being allowed to work from home tended to be a privilege only
granted to some and only for a limited amount of time. The vast majority
of respondents were sure that their jobs allowed for at least some
flexibility in terms of location. Still, this didn't impact the
likeliness that people were comfortable to ask to be allowed to work
from home at times. Today, this has completely changed and what often
was a 'right to be earned' has become the regular way of working for a
large share of the workforce globally.

**How we are working in 2020**

Working from home has become the current norm for many employees in jobs
that allow for work to be done in this way. No longer do they need to
ask permission, but instead it has become the mandated prescription to
protect health. While the ability to work from home has now opened up to
many people who were not doing this previously, discrepancies remain in
who can do this. Not all people are included based on the nature of
their work, such as service providers, health care, manufacturing, and
essential workers. Many low-income jobs have no ability to be performed
outside of the office or workplace. Also, some people may not have a
space, equipment, furnishings, or quality internet access for a home
office. When not well designed and supported, inequality gaps may be
further widened in this new working model.

For those now working from home, this has become a new standard for how
they will view work going forward. The barriers to employees asking and
managers deciding have been removed by the new default of many working
from home. Their lived experiences working from home now disprove any
excuses that were previously given for why employees could not do their
jobs outside of the office. Productivity and economic impact have been
shown to still be achieved when working from home. During the summer of
2020 in the U.S.,
[62%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/306695/workers-discovering-affinity-remote-work.aspx)
of workers have worked from home, which is double pre-pandemic rates and
this way of working now accounts for [2/3's of U.S.
GDP.](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/06/29/snapshot-new-working-home-economy/#:~:text=We%20see%20an%20incredible%2042,working%20on%20their%20business%20premises.)
A [majority of employees in France and the
U.K](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/317681/remote-work-outcomes-depend-manager.aspx).
who have been working from home during the pandemic, say that they want
to continue working this way.

Many workplaces are reassessing their policies and practices on where
work is performed, and in the U.S. one
[survey](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time)
found over 80% will allow some form of working outside of the office.
Our 'new normal' will continue to evolve and likely be very different
from the past. Ahead will be how to equitably manage employees working
from many locations, including the office, home, and other spots.

**An opportunity to reframe how we reference work going forward**

The pandemic has accelerated a shift in where and how work gets done.
Literally overnight, what was happening within a small subset of the
workforce has now opened up to include much more people. Needed now is
to leverage this and reset our models on work to shift away from
*location* and to instead be about *collaboration*, *purpose*, and
*results*, as well as expanding this way of working to *equitably
include more people*. This will involve many changes. One of the first
being to reset our language to accurately reinforce the new working
design.

Often, we refer to this way of working as 'remote work' or the people
who do it as 'remote workers' or 'distance workers'. Underlying these
terms, is the default perspective of a 'normal' worker is office-based.
'Remote' only emphasises that people who work this way are *not* the
norm; they are outliers. This casts a shadow over the person and their
work. The word 'remote' brings up negative imagery. It's hard to feel
warmth towards a 'distant', 'remote' person. As warmth is one of the
[key
criteria](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417738825)
that we use to evaluate people, this can trigger behavioural challenges
towards collaboration, performance evaluations, and career
opportunities. The phrase of 'remote' clearly does not put this way of
working in a desired framing nor set it up for the new normal going
forward.

Similarly, we frequently call this way of working as 'virtual work'. The
issue with this framing is that 'virtual' is an imitation of the 'real
thing'. It implies that somehow this is 'not real work', and by default
'real work' happens in the office. Again, this term is problematic, as
the news reporter realised when he said "*met virtually*" and then
corrected himself to simply say "*met"*.

**Now is the time for a reset on how we think about, talk about, and do
work in new ways. Instead of using adjectives that qualify the work based on a location
perspective, let's use words that focus on the work itself and the people
themselves. Let's just call it 'work' and let's just call them 'workers'!**

**Inclusive ways to make this reframing of perspectives happen**

To support surfacing limiting perspectives and implementing new policies
and processes to support how work gets done, Lisa Kepinski and Tinna C.
Nielsen have shared many examples in The Inclusion Nudges Guidebook
(3<sup>rd</sup> edition, 2020) and 30 examples in each of the books in the Action
Guide Series.

By applying Inclusion Nudges, you can more effectively reduce the impact
of bias towards others and how they work. These behavioural designs can
help you get people motivated to make new changes, take action to reset
how work gets done and evaluated, and shift the language and mental
models. These designs can also be used to surface previously unseen
patterns of who has access to working from home and what could be the
implications of gaps in who can and who can't. As you go forward with
redefining work in your organization, we encourage you to try apply the
change methodology of Inclusion Nudges. These make inclusion the norm
everywhere, for everyone.
