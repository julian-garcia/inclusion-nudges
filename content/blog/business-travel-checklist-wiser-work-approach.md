**Checklists can be a powerful tool to help us make wiser decisions when complexity is high. Checklists enable us to act and make decisions based on facts and considered perspectives rather than leaving our decision-making to unreflective thinking based on old habits and out-of-date defaults.**

**Checklists can improve diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts just like checklists have improved aviation, healthcare, construction, and investment banking for decades. Time has come to use a checklist to make wise decisions about business travel. Let’s be deliberative and certain that traveling and showing up in-person is actually the best course of action and not the automatic way we approach work just because that’s how it used to be done.** 

## Why change the business travel default

During the pandemic lockdown, business travel mostly stopped and we found alternative ways to connect and conduct business. As we move forward having to live with the COVID-19 virus, we have a chance for a [catapult change mindset](https://inclusion-nudges.org/blog/change-maker-skills/elastic-band-catapult-mindset) to innovate on business travel.

Never has a review of travel been more needed (see the urgent call to climate action in the [UN report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/)). Consider these [facts](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200218-climate-change-how-to-cut-your-carbon-emissions-when-flying): Just 1 round-trip flight London-San Francisco has more than 2x the yearly emissions of a family car and just 1 round-trip short flight London-Berlin produces 3x the emissions saved by a full year of recycling. And this is just one flight! Think of how many flights we and our colleagues took in the year before the pandemic. About [30%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-07-14/raytheon-ceo-on-inflation-space-travel-coming-back-to-office-video) of flights pre-pandemic were business trip related with many not really essential but instead were the default for how work was done. Business travel also was often at premium prices accounting for about [75% of airline profits and 66% of hotel profits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-31/will-business-travel-come-back-data-show-air-hotel-travel-forever-changed). According to the Global Business Travel Association, corporate trip expenditure in 2019 was [1.43 trillion USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-31/will-business-travel-come-back-data-show-air-hotel-travel-forever-changed). 

Heavy business travel was certainly a reality for us (Tinna & Lisa) up until January 2020. It was not unusual for us to spend less time with the client than we actually spent in travel time. This had a toll on us, our families, and the environment, and potentially was an unnecessary expense to the organisation. 
In the lockdown year of 2020, Amazon and Google each [reported](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/transportation/future-of-business-travel-post-covid.html) savings in travel expenses of 1 billion USD. This type of savings (on different scales) has no doubt been seen in many organisations around the world over the past 1½ years. At the close of 2020, experts were [predicting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-covid-pandemic-could-cut-business-travel-by-36permanently-11606830490) a permanent 36% cut in business trips, and this continues with an August 2021 [survey](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-31/will-business-travel-come-back-data-show-air-hotel-travel-forever-changed) of business executives in the U.S., Europe, & Asia reporting an 84% reduction in travel going forward and another global [survey](https://www.conference-board.org/research/csuitechallenge/c-suite-challenge-leading-post-covid-19-recovery) of CEOs and executives citing that a reduction in business travel is likely to be a permanent legacy of the pandemic. So, it seems that we’re on a path of a more sustainable approach to work travel, doesn’t it? 

## But still business travel is starting to creep back

We easily can revert to past patterns without thinking about it. We are influenced by factors such as a return for some people to office-based work and an overall feeling of pandemic fatigue coupled with a confidence from high vaccinations rates in some countries. A yearning for back to ‘normal’ can mean a return to traveling to offices, in-person team meetings, visits to clients’ sites, attending in-person trainings, conferences, sales events, and more. Still, the travel uptake rate is slow for now. For the remainder of 2021 in the U.S., business travel is predicted at only [30%](https://www.axios.com/business-travel-post-pandemic-comeback-05a09a33-33f6-4762-89ef-6c47fab90b26.html) of 2019 levels. 

<p class="center-bold">We are still within a window to apply what we have learned about how to work without traveling. We can change how we work going forward.</p>

**Making deliberate and wise choices**

We are not saying that there shouldn’t be any face-to-face meetings involving travel, but we do want to make sure we are aligning our intentions for a more sustainable approach for ourselves, the organisation, and the world. 

**Interrupt a return to old ways of working**

To help interrupt an automatic return to the old ways of working and default business travel, we have developed a checklist to help guide transparent information gathering, to check in on actual needs, emotions, and aid decision-making on business travel. This can be used by both people with external and internal roles when requested to travel. 

**How to use the checklist - together**

We encourage that the checklist be used by both the person making the request and the person being requested to travel, and then have a joint discussion sharing each other’s responses for an inclusive, collaborative decision-making process. 

## The Inclusion Nudges Checklist for Business Travel
*Version: October 2021*

### 1. Start with a ‘no-business-travel’ default!

***Why? What is the behavioural science insight?***

Defaults are powerful determinators of our behaviour because we blindly follow the default and it’s very difficult for us to deselect and opt-out of a default because it activated our loss-aversion bias (when we want to avoid losing and missing out on something). Equally, it can be very difficult to opt-in on something new because the unconscious mind, which is controlling most of our behaviour and decisions, has a preference for the familiar, the usual, and the recognisable patterns. Business traveling still goes in that category because it’s been the norm much longer than no traveling due to pandemic lockdown. 
Default design is a very effective behavioural design to change norms and un-reflected decisions. In this case, default design is used instead of asking people to opt-in on a new norm, such as ‘business travel is not needed’, and also instead of asking people to opt-out of a familiar norm, like ‘business travel is normal’. It’s important to make ‘no business travel’ the default. Now, the decision has to be made based on arguments about ‘why business travel is needed’ and not the other way around. Such behavioural insights designs will make a crucial difference. 

### 2. Create a checklist

Here are some questions, arguments, factors that you should consider and discuss with your collaborators and/or ‘requestor’. These are suggestions you can use when making your checklist. 

We will for sure use these ourselves to make sure traveling for business actually is a necessity and not just a habit and stuck assumptions.

| **ENVIRONMENT**:                                                                              |        |

| **EXPENSE:** ||
| What’s the estimated cost for travel, not only for myself but all participants for the in-person work? ||
| Will the travel requestor cover all health expenses associated with the trip (i.e., tests, masks, potential quarantine requirements, cancellation penalties, etc.)?||
| Is there an extra bonus paid to the person who agrees to travel?  If so, what is it?||
| How much could be saved by not traveling? What are two ways that this money could be used differently (instead of on travel)?||


**My final test: I mentally walk-through the travel and the work from ‘door to door’/step by step.**
Make a tick mark on paper each time I register a feeling or thought of discomfort, concern, and/or questioning as I do this mental travel. Afterwards (when I have mentally returned home), count how many concerned times (marks) I registered as I pictured the travel & in-person experience. 
What did I notice?

**Some final reflective questions to inform my decision:**
- Does my decision to travel/not travel for business feel right?
- What do I personally loose by leaving home for this business trip? What do I gain?
- How do I personally feel/think about doing this trip?
