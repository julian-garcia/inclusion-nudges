Great question, Barry, and thank you for inviting us to share our thoughts about this both in this blog post and at Legal Islandâ€™s annual D&I Summit in late March 2021. (Here is a recording of [Lisaâ€™s presentation](https://legal-island.wistia.com/medias/bs7uopj2dk).) Thereâ€™s a lot that we could cover, but to start off in this posting, letâ€™s focus on how framing perceptions can support inclusion in how we are working today. We will pick up other themes on inclusion and the ways we are working in future articles.

## What we call â€˜workâ€™ matters â€“ words matter

First, we probably should acknowledge that we have a language framing issue on what to call how and where work gets done now, due to the new work experiences caused by the pandemic lockdown (2020-2021). We (Tinna and Lisa) are stumbling and catching ourselves constantly on how to talk about work nowâ€”what words should we use!? Should we call it â€˜virtual workâ€™?  Or â€˜remote workingâ€™? Or simply â€˜workâ€™? Does it matter? We addressed this in a previous blog post on the need to [reframe how we work today](/blog/frame-perceptions/reframe-how-we-work) and also what we call it. And yes, it does matter. 

We came to the conclusion to simply just say â€˜workâ€™ irrespective of where it gets done. And if we need to distinguish, we often say â€˜online workâ€™, â€˜offline workâ€™, and â€˜in-person workâ€™. Although we canâ€™t predict that weâ€™ll keep on using these terms. So much is still evolving on naming new work experiences resulting from the historic time with so many people working from home. One term and direction that is emerging for many people working in organisations (especially â€˜knowledge workersâ€™) is that work will become a blended â€˜hybridâ€™ approach across personal offices and company offices. Did you notice how we didnâ€™t say â€˜home officesâ€™? ðŸ™‚

## Whoâ€™s valued

This focus on language and words is actually serious stuff. 

Our perceptions and descriptions of each other, the work we do, and how it is done can have career-defining impact. Ways of working influences performance and potential judgements. 

>**CASE:**\
In one of Lisaâ€™s past organisations, anyone who was designated as a â€˜high potential talentâ€™ but then went part-time was automatically (and without any discussion) removed from the â€˜high potential listâ€™. The underlying belief was that â€˜part-timeâ€™ was equivalent with â€˜part-time commitmentâ€™ â€“ it didnâ€™t equal â€˜fully committedâ€™ and thus they were viewed as less valuable to the company by the way they worked. 

Another language implication is that prior to the Corona pandemic â€˜work from homeâ€™ was frequently seen as less legitimate than other ways of working outside of the office, such as sales work or work during business travels. Automatically â€˜homeâ€™ denoted â€˜not a real workplaceâ€™ and thus â€˜not real workâ€™. This led to a framing of â€˜work from homeâ€™ as a â€˜working motherâ€™s thingâ€™ and not something that is open to all people. Thatâ€™s really been put to the challenge with the experiences of many â€˜knowledge workersâ€™ during the pandemic having home as the only place to work.

## What works: Change the default

As we create new ways of working going forward, weâ€™ll need to notice and question the perceptions and models for how work happens. For example, instead of asking *â€˜Should we still work in a distributed way?â€™*, try flipping this to a more inclusive default such as, *â€˜We work in multiple locationsâ€™* (and make a checklist with criteria to decide when to meet in person as a team or with colleagues/stakeholders and schedule it so all can participate). Make it the norm to ask *â€˜Why not continue to work from anywhere?â€™*. This helps to reduce resistance and frees up innovative thinking by changing the default of â€˜prove itâ€™ (why) to â€˜we do itâ€™ (why not). This also works by starting from a position that â€˜this is the normâ€™. Default design works like this â€“ instead of asking people to â€˜opt inâ€™, by default they are all â€˜inâ€™ and have the freedom to â€˜opt outâ€™. In this case, this means that all can work where they want to without being implicitly sanctioned for not â€˜fitting inâ€™ and â€˜not being committed enoughâ€™. 

>**CASE:**\
Aligned with this is an innovative approach that weâ€™ve noticed of some organisations making the decision to go 100% â€˜remote workingâ€™ as their usual way of working. This is described as â€˜remote firstâ€™ or â€˜virtual firstâ€™. This means that the default for how work gets done is remote, and when teams come together for in-person work this will be the exception to the norm. 

>Supporting that new approach and mindset, these companies have dropped the use the word â€˜officeâ€™ and now call the companyâ€™s physical workplaces terms like â€˜collaborative spacesâ€™ and â€˜company conference centerâ€™ to signal (frame) a purpose for why and when staff meet in person.

## Hybrid officeâ€”watch out for â€˜usâ€™ and â€˜themâ€™

Today, we have some parts of the world re-emerging from the pandemic lockdowns and discussions about returning to the office. While at the same time, as we are writing this blog article, so many parts of the world have not yet achieved health stability to have such a discussion yet. Plus, employees around the world are expressing no interest in working in their companyâ€™s office as they did in the past, while leaders are pointing that a return is expected when possible. At the same time, many people cannot wait to get back into the physical space of the organisation to avoid a chaotic situation of working from home and many people miss working side-by-side (in person) with their colleagues. 

It is not far-fetched to predict that we will see disparities in the new model of the hybrid workplace. What is clear is that there is low tolerance of the old workplace norm of presenteeism - a need to be seen in the office in order to be perceived as a great performer. To help lessen such a preference bias to the â€˜inner circleâ€™ of â€˜office-based staffâ€™, organisations will need heightened focus on applying designs to support inclusion of all regardless of where they work in the hybrid workplace. Weâ€™ll write about some of these process designs in future blog posts.
