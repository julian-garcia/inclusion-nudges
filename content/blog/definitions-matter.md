_Learn_ **WHY** it matters how we frame diversity, equity, belonging,
and inclusion, & belonging work and efforts. The outcomes are impacted
by how we define the terms. We share the definitions behind the
Inclusion Nudges change approach and how these make a powerful
difference in revealing barriers and engaging people to take action to
make inclusion the norm.

**"*Uhhh!*" or "*Blah blah blah!*" - Reactions a word can trigger**

Imagine if we could see what people are thinking when they hear the
words "*diversity*", "*equity*", "*inclusion*", and other words used
within the context of change initiatives and efforts for greater
inclusivity. What thoughts, feelings, associations, memories, and mental
constructs are sparked when you hear these words? What do you think
could be activated in other people by these words? Here are some of the
patterns that we have seen during the past couple of decades that we've
been working on these issues. Do any of these situations below sound
familiar to you?

"Oh, diversity isn't my issue! It only applies to people from the
minority groups, not me!"

"I am the one being discriminated against. Don't ask me how to fix it - it's your problem." (meaning: majority group people)

"Don't ask me how to fix it. You're diverse, so you need to fix it - it's your problem." (meaning: minority group people)

"Diversity and inclusion are not my day job, so I don't really have
time for that. Someone else has got to fix it."

"Let's make sure we attract some diversity talent." (meaning: minority
or women)

"If we are going to promote women and minorities, then we have to
exclude others." (meaning: white men)

**We are setting up hidden trip wires**

Let's take a closer look at the underlying understandings and
perceptions in these patterns. This is our interpretation based on
decades of working in the field of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and
these are backed by multiple studies by other experts as well.

**Some perceptions behind the words**

- only some people are diverse and not others

- the privileged and the majority are discriminating and that's why
**they** have to solve the problem themselves

- the underprivileged and the minorities are discriminated against and
that's why **they** have to solve the problem

- I don't have the job as the diversity and inclusion specialist, so I
don't have to do anything to contribute

- diversity means only minorities and women

- white men loose power and entitlement through inclusion and equity for
all

These reactions and perceptions are a result of how the efforts for
diversity, equity, and inclusion have been positioned and addressed for
many years. Often, organisations develop strategies and set diversity
targets for minorities and women but not for all people. They create
initiatives that aim to 'help the minority'. Or they make programs for
gender equality but only target women which makes it about 'fixing the
women'.

Missing is a focus on engaging **all people** (majority +
minority). Missing is changing the implicit norms and redesigning the
systems to combat discriminatory practices. The results often end up
being about 'fixing the difference' and assimilation rather than being
inclusive of all people and their attributes. These definitions create
division and reinforce 'us and them' bias.

**Framing in this way actually works against the intentions of achieving the benefits of diversity and excludes people.**

Often with the best of intentions of attracting attention to these
issues to make fundamental changes, we (the professionals and activists
who advocate for this) articulate the words "inclusion", "diversity",
"equity", and what they mean in abstract terms. We do this in ways that
aren't grounded in common understanding, nor supporting action-taking,
and frequently based on misperceptions. This creates a significant
challenge and a stuck pattern that limits achieving the intended
outcomes of our work. To make progress, we need to get to the core of
the issue. It matters what definitions we apply and the words we use.
And perhaps like us, Lisa and Tinna, you've fallen into this trap as
well?

**When words create absurd realities**

It's difficult to imagine that 'words' and 'definitions' can be a trip
wire for all our hard work. Really, *words*?!

Language is one of the defining aspects of what makes us human.[^1] It
shapes our perceptions, behaviours, and cultures.[^2] Science has shown
in many ways how powerful words are. For example, through the priming
effect[^3] words (and images) can unconsciously influence our thoughts
and resulting behaviours. A study revealed this when people were shown
words associated with the 'elderly' (like "*wrinkle*" and
"*forgetful*"), and afterwards these study participants walked slower
than others who were shown neutral words.[^4] Words can also reinforce
stereotypes, even when we are trying to change these. A study examining
how to encourage girls by saying "*girls are as good as boys at math*"
actually backfired by heightening the false belief (stereotype) that
boys are actually better at math.[^5] Words do have power!

**The fear of loss**

In addition to shaping our perceptions and behaviours, words also carry
meaning that triggers emotions. Studies have shown that emotions are a
powerful driver of our unconscious thinking, decision-making, and
behaviours.[^6] One way this can impact our work in diversity, equity,
and inclusion is how the words may block people from engaging in the
needed changes. If a person perceives diversity as a zero-sum game
(one's gain is another's loss), then equality will mean having to give
up own's own power and privilege. This triggers the loss-aversion
bias.[^7] This bias influences our behaviour in ways where we will avoid
change and fight to maintain the status quo.

**Strengthening tribalism**

Another way that words can trigger emotions is centred on our innate
fear of the 'unknown'. Our instinctive tribal mentality will also be
activated when we have to interact with people from our 'out groups'.
This creates an unconscious, irrational fear and anxious reaction. This
influences our behaviour in ways that we exclude (unintentionally)
knowledge and information shared by 'out group' members. And with our
familiar 'in group' members, we include them more and we trust and
process more of what they share with us. Our emotional reactions impact
how we sort through input (words and content) and shapes our
understandings (mental models).

**Shaming**

There's an often an unspoken, yet powerful, emotional impact of words in
diversity, equity, and inclusion work that creates a huge stuck pattern
to change-making. This is the feeling of shame. For some people, they
may feel this when hearing the language that we use in this work. Often
this stems from them previously having been blamed for discriminating
(without knowing they did and without intention) or because they are
ashamed of being so privileged and witnessing inequality without knowing
what to do to contribute to change this. This influences our behaviours
in ways where we unconsciously attack (micro-aggressions) the people who
make us feel this way, even when consciously not wanting to do that.

Clearly, words and how we use them can have a profound impact on
engaging others in diversity, equity, and inclusion change initiatives
and can significantly impact success. These are just a few examples of
the reactions triggered in people and the behaviours fostered when
people hear the words "diversity", "equality", and "inclusion".

**Left unaddressed, words can create an absurd reality and limit achieving our good intentions. Getting clear on definitions is like having guiding stars**

In our decades of experience as change makers and advisors, we have
realised how rarely the definitions are formally articulated, yet the
words "diversity", "equity", "belonging", and "inclusion" are
nevertheless widely used - and yes, we have also fallen into this trap.

The result is that people within a community or organisation are left on
their own to understand what the terms mean. This results in widely
different mindsets that impact who engages and how they do so. An
unspoken assumption prevails that all people understand the same frame
of reference. But we don't since our own lived experiences, social
constructs, and knowledge vary widely. For some, "diversity" may equal
only "women". For others, "inclusion" may only be having activities and
programs like "diversity networks", while for others "inclusion" means
applying the diversity of perspectives and knowledge in a group. And for
"equity", this may be seen as simply having "diversity (minority) hiring
targets". While these words can mean these things, they are not the full
scope. By not having a common framework of understanding, it becomes an
absurd reality to expect that actions of people will be aligned. The
result is often that progress gets stuck.

As the founders of the Inclusion Nudges global initiative, we use the
definitions as a guide for what we want to achieve - the kind of
workplaces we want to work in, the kind of communities we want to be
part of, and the kind of societies we want to live in. (You can learn
more about the Inclusion Nudges global initiative in [this blog article](/blog/about-inclusion-nudges/power-of-inclusion-nudges)).
We use the definitions to guide the design work needed to achieve this
in actions, behaviours, systems, and cultures. Before we dig into that
part, let's begin with the definitions that we use in our work.

> **Diversity: The Mix of All of Us**

> Diversity is about people. This includes their demographic
> differences, backgrounds, multiple identities, and their unique
> experiences, perspectives, knowledge, abilities, ideas, and more.
> Diversity is not referencing specific characteristics of only 'the
> minority' within a group of people or in society. Diversity is
> referencing all people and differences among us. Diversity is the mix
> of all of us.

> **Equity: The Fairness Frame for the Mix**

> Equity is about ensuring that all people have equal access to
> opportunities and fair treatment, and ensuring elimination of
> discriminatory practices, systems, laws, policies, social norms, and
> cultural traditions. Equity encompasses a balancing of power and
> correcting where inequality exists. It is also about patterns of
> behaviour and processes developed and used which may be continuing
> inequality. Within some contexts, equity may have a legal mandate
> attached to achieving it, along with penalties for not. The intent of
> equity is fairness to all.

> **Belonging: I Feel Valued as a Part of the Mix**

> Belonging focuses on the person's experience within a setting--they
> are welcomed, structures exist to ensure fairness, and they feel that
> they can be their full, authentic self within that culture, group, or
> setting. They don't have to cover who they are or downplay personal
> traits. As a result, they don't suffer the limiting toll this can
> bring. Belonging is when people feel seen and heard, feel they
> naturally belong to a group, feel safe, and feel valued. This results
> from having equitable and inclusive practices, norms, cultures, and
> systems. When diversity, equity, and inclusion are done well, then
> belonging results.

> **Inclusion: Welcoming and Applying the Mix**

> Inclusion is focused on fostering the structure, system, processes,
> culture, behaviour, and mindset that embrace and respect all people
> and all our diversity. It embraces all people. Inclusion is about
> ensuring that diversity of knowledge, perspectives, information, and
> ideas are welcomed & being used. Inclusion is when we seek out
> diversity, when we challenge excluding norms and stereotypes, when we
> are open to others, and when we speak up. Inclusion is when all people
> are valued and able to participate and contribute to their fullest.
> Inclusion is welcoming and applying the mix of all of us.

But simply articulating and communicating the definitions is not enough.
A rational understanding of the definitions is NOT what gets us to act
inclusively and value diversity. This is because rational understanding
is in the conscious mind, system 2, which is not the system doing our
behaviour. This mind is more like our guide that steer us in the right
direction, if that direction and destination makes sense. As the
diversity and inclusion specialist, you can define and articulate this
based on your insights about what makes sense in the context you
operate. For example, you can use the vocabulary of your strategy or the
frequently-used words in your organisation, such as performance,
innovation, agility, global mindset, authenticity, creativity, future of
work, and much more that are relevant to your context. This is a very
common approach. But here is the problem. What makes sense to the
individual is rarely any of this. And the words can even create distance
and mistrust when actions don't match up with the words (definitions).
That's why it's a must to engage 'the people it's about' in defining
what diversity, equity, belonging, and inclusion are to them.

**Inclusive definitions of inclusive actions**

Having a foundation for common understanding is vital for alignment,
engagement, and progress. It also helps to prime (or steer) thinking
towards the desired outcomes. You may find it useful to leverage our
definitions in your change-making work.

Another, and better option, is to involve all people to be a part of
setting and validating the definitions your group or organisation. **But
don't make it about words. Make it about actions.** Get people engaged
in identifying the actions and behaviours that they perceive as
inclusive, inviting, respectful, empathetic, and that makes them feel
included, belonging, valued, growing, and empowered. The outcomes of
this approach are not only definitions that fit for your context but
also by including 'the people it's about' in the development process,
then they are already onboarded in the change initiative. This approach
is inclusive, leveraging diversity within the group, and it gives people
ownership.

**So, what do you then do with all these examples of inclusive
behaviour?**

Make them visible to all people by sharing all these diverse real-life
practical examples and personal stories in communication materials. And
display many of these on the walls in your factories, offices, meeting
rooms, hall ways, town squares, billboards and more. This illustrates
how inclusion plays out in so many ways (but don't use the word
'inclusion'). Read here to learn how to design such an Inclusion Nudge.
Don't put all these great lived experiences in a spreadsheet, slides, or
document and send it to people in an email because it's too complex to
act on (does that approach sound familiar?). It's not going to make a
difference.

When communicating about this in, for example, internal communication
only share one example at the time and let people know that it's their
peers and similar others who are doing this. If you have data about the
majority of people are doing something concrete, then make sure to
communicate specifically that i.e. "8 out of 10 of your neighbours or
colleagues (similar others and peers) are doing xx".

**Achieve inclusion without talking about inclusion**

Over time, a shared understanding of inclusion, diversity, belonging,
and equity will take shape. You might also want to formulate a
definition because you need to include it in your strategy, KPIs/target
documents, other materials, and on your website. But don't overuse the
words. Don't create buzz words.

We deal with this in a couple of ways. One is to shift the perception
away from the word itself to instead focus on the action. Another way to
stay focused on action in how you frame and talk about these topics. For
example, we often say when referencing "*inclusion*", something like
"*it's how work gets done here*" or "*it's* *how people experience being
in the group*". We challenge ourselves, and others, to not say the words
at all but instead reference the desired outcomes. For example, "*we
need the thinking from everyone for new solutions*" or "*we need our
systems designed to enable our most objective decision making*". With a
common frame for the concepts that is aligned to the intended outcomes,
we can be more successful in our change work.

These are examples of how you can create perceptions of diversity and
inclusion that are resource-oriented and with positive associations in
the human mind. All of this is pertinent to foster inclusive behaviours
and cultures in organisations and communities and make it the norm,
rather than a 'stand-alone initiative'.

The challenge is really how definitions becomes reality. How do you
actually get thousands of people to do this in their actions and
behaviours and move in the same direction with all their different
understandings and reactions - and at the same time? Well, that's the
headache of most people working with change. This is also why we
developed the Inclusion Nudges change approach. In our blog posts and in
The Inclusion Nudges Guidebook and the Inclusion Nudges Action Guide
Series, you will find many examples of how you can do this.

**We invite you to become a part of the Inclusion Nudges movement by
applying this change approach.**

**Let&#39;s join forces! Together we can make inclusion the norm—everywhere, for everyone!**
