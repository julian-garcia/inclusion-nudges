Do you want make good decisions and come up with new and better
solutions? Here are 4 practical ways that you get access to diversity
and reduce the negative influences of biases.

**Mitigate unconscious bias throughout the process**

Given that innovation is about finding new and better solutions, it is
important to mitigate bias and preferences for information, knowledge,
insights, and ideas that we unconsciously recognise as familiar. We also
need to make sure we get access to the diversity in the group of people
that we collaborate with throughout the entire process. The same goes
for making good decisions. The problem is that we often don't leverage
the potential of people and groups. And what a waste of talent and human
potential that is.

To avoid this loss of human potential, you can counter this with simple
process design Inclusion Nudges. Some of these are briefly described
below.

***Anonymous and written sharing*:** In meetings, participants write
their input on notes (anonymously) before anyone talks. This ensures
that contributors experience psychological safety and everyone has
access to a diversity of voices and perspectives[^1].

***Reversed default*:** When discussing which ideas are best and why,
change the default starting point to be 'all ideas are the best' and
'why not this idea?'. This changes the perspective.

***Perspective taking*:** Bias can be mitigated by increasing our
ability to take the perspective of others. To do this, apply designs
that prompt our thinking with questions about what others would have
done, such as "*What would your grandfather do about this*?" or "*What
would a community member with a chronic disease do here*?". It decreases
stereotypical biases at both conscious and non-conscious levels.[^2]
This mitigates bias and stereotypes in the co-production process - but
not by the intentional suppression of stereotypical thoughts, because
that has been proven by research ironically to produce the very thoughts
one is suppressing.[^3]

***Flip Questions*:** Encourage participants to ask what we call Flip
Questions inside their own mind as they interact. Examples are "*If he
was not a social welfare recipient, but a doctor, would I find him more
competent?*" or "*If she was a man, would I interpret what she just did
differently*?". This helps to change biased judgements and perceptions
during interactions, and thus also to change behaviour (the way we
listen and engage).

In a facilitated co-creation process, evaluation of diverse inputs and
ideas by participants in the process is ongoing. Various biases will
inevitably occur. We all do this, ourselves included. Therefore, it's
important that the process is designed and facilitated to mitigate
biases, as well as to counter negative group dynamics, such as group
conformity and self-silencing. This has proven an effective way to
access diversity of thought, give people a voice, and ensure a feeling
of inclusion and empowerment, as well as ownership during and after the
process.

**Here is a challenge for you!**

Watch Tinna's [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VggAqa0xOwM)
and take part in a live experiment.\
You also get more inspiration to make your own Flip Questions as well as
other process designs.
