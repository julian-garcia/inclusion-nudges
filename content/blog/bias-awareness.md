**Unconscious bias awareness training has become the most used response
to combatting discrimination and inequality, and a quick fix solution to
try to achieve equity and inclusion. It's a global trend and a big
industry. But we have a problem -- at best it's just ineffective, at
worse it backlashes. Here's why it's not the way forward and why we need
to design our way towards a more just world for the greater good of
all.**

## What's up with all this bias training?

Does this sound like a familiar pattern in organisations?

**\#MeToo Movement**

= Let's do an unconscious bias awareness training!

**\#BlackLivesMatter**

= Let's do *another* unconscious bias training!

**Employee grievance complaint based on treatment from 1 person**

= Bias training for *all people*!

**Let's show we are supportive of diversity, equity & inclusion**

= Yep, you guessed it---*bias training*!

There is an all too familiar rush to do unconscious bias awareness
trainings when leaders are confronted about cases in their organisations
of exclusion, disrespect, discrimination, and a lack of leveraging the
full potential of all people. The prevailing mindset is to trust that
training will 'fix' the issues. In some cases, training is used like a
defensive shield against calls for change to be more inclusive. The
statement of "*we're offering bias training across the organisation*"
becomes seemingly proof that "*things are going to change here*". But
that usually doesn't happen. "*How can this be*?", you might be
wondering.

**Why bias training is not the solution**

Over-reliance on unconscious bias awareness training as 'the solution'
has created a multi-billion dollar-a-year industry that is profiting
from many thinking this approach will 'fix the problem'. Yet often, the
outcomes of these bias trainings are not effective and the problem
persists. It may even get bigger!

This stems from a false self-belief and overconfidence in our thinking
abilities. Knowing in our rational, conscious (system 2) mind about bias
and group dynamics, and having good intentions, does not reduce the
impact of the unconscious mind. The unconscious (system 1) mind is where
the vast majority of our cognitive functioning (including bias) happens.
Training that is knowledge-based appeals to the wrong thinking system if
we want lasting behavioural change. Training is not going to work when
it aims to convince people to be more inclusive and make them aware of
their unconscious biases and stereotypes.

**Not only are we talking to the wrong brain system, we are speaking the
wrong language.**

**Mental overload**

Having to be consciously aware of the unconscious comes at the risk of
creating mental overload, which has been proven to strengthen the impact
of bias. Furthermore, when knowing (system 2) but not having the ability
to act on that knowledge, it can paralyse us (system 1) and then we rely
even more on default and biased behaviour. So, you see this creates a
vicious circle.

**Enhance bias and stereotypes**

Research and real experiences are showing that unconscious bias
awareness training can backfire because it unintentionally [enhances
more biased thinking and behaviours, as well as strengthens
stereotypes](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2014-43472-001).

**Lean back because 'bias is natural'**

By hearing that others are biased and its 'natural' to hold stereotypes,
we feel less motivated to change biases or worse.

**Activate shame and fear**

Another
[challenge](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inclusion-Nudges-Guidebook-how-bias/dp/B086PMRGNY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2F38TZX4419EU&dchild=1&keywords=inclusion+nudges+guidebook&qid=1589357761&sprefix=inclusion+nudges+%2Caps%2C165&sr=8-1)
we have identified over the years, is the term 'Unconscious Bias
Awareness Training', or for that matter 'Inclusion & Diversity
Training'. This is because these terms often trigger connotations and
associations in the unconscious mind that activates counter-productive
emotions and reactions, such as these below.

"*I am going to be fixed*." (anxiety)

"*I'll lose privilege, status, and power*." (loss-aversion)

"*Now, I'll get them and show them how wrong they are*." (revenge)

"*Now, I know my bias and control it*." (over-optimism)

**Trigger 'moral licensing'**

Attending such training can create a self-perception of having control
of ones' biases and being one of the 'good people' who are not
discriminating. This has proven to trigger moral licensing, which makes
our behaviour not only non-inclusive, but the very opposite of our
stated values, beliefs, and intentions. Moral licensing is an
unconscious mental phenomenon in which a positive self-image makes our
unconscious mind more likely to make immoral choices.
[Studies](http://www.ask-force.org/web/Discourse/Monin-Moral-Credentials-Prejudice-2001.pdf)
have shown that people who expressed strong disagreement with sexist
statements are more likely to hire a man for a job and make sexist
comments because they feel secure about their 'non-sexist' self-image.
People who express disagreement with racist statements have also been
shown to be more likely to unconsciously discriminate against racial
minorities.

Well, given that this is the opposite of what we need, let's do
something proven to work!

**Some positive effects we can leverage**

The strong preference for bias training as 'the solution' is not just a
search for a 'quick fix', it is also an exÂ­pression of hope that
training will somehow 'fix' our biased thinking, interactions, and
processes. We, Lisa and Tinna, do acknowledge that such sessions can
create a shared experience and insights, Also, through the use
aha-moments this can prompt self-reflection and spotting of previously
unseen patterns of discrimination and bias. The positive outcome can be
a shared language that can ease conversations about root causes that
need to be addressed in the organisation or community.

But is that enough to change organisations and people's behaviour? No!
Studies show that at best, any positive results only last a few days.

## Here's an effective path to take to de-bias

We cannot change and redesign how the human mind works. Knowing about
our cognitive biases and the gap between the two systems in our mind,
will not change how it influences us.

**We can work with our inter-dependent cognitive systems by changing the barriers of the mind into strengths.**

We must appeal to the unconscious system to find the solutions because
this is the mind doing our behaviour. So how can we do this? Let's take
a closer look at how we can make this happen by using the power of
Inclusion Nudges. These make a profound difference in combatting biases
and absurd realities.

**What is an Inclusion Nudge?**

> An Inclusion Nudge is an action designed to influence the unconscious
> mind and makes it easy to be inclusive and do inclusion automatically
> in daily actions. These actions are practical applications insights
> about human behaviour and decision making (from behavioural and social
> sciences, nudge theory, as well as knowledge about the hidden barriers
> to achieve inclusion). These inclusive actions and designs work
> because they nudge (steer) the unconscious mind (your own and that of
> others) to change behaviour to be inclusive automatically.

Inclusion Nudges work by minimising the impact of mental shortcuts
(biases) and not relying on the conscious mind to drive change. As a
result, you don't need to use rational arguments to convince people to
change. Inclusion Nudges make the desired behaviour automatic, aligning
our behaviour with our self-interest and intent. This happens without
the use of threats or punishment and by respecting freedom of choice.
And this happens usually with very little cost involved. Now, that's
effective sounding, isn't it?

Anonymising candidates is an example of an Inclusion Nudge. This is
finally spreading and becoming more normal in many organisations and the
emergence of technological platforms are easing the facilitation of
this. But, we still find it crazy that so many people have known about
the positive impact of this design, yet so few have implemented this
simple change. We have had this evidence for more than 40 years! We
think it's fair to say that we have to speed it up.

**Awareness is not the solution.**

**We have to mitigate the influence of unconscious bias by nudging the unconscious mind to be inclusive by default and as the norm**

We have used these change designs for years, and so have thousands of
people around the world.

We encourage you to give it a try.

Let's make inclusion the norm everywhere, for everyone.
