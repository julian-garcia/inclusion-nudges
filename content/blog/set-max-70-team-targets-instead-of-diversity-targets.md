**Why not set diversity targets? Sounds crazy? Well, it makes a big difference to flip the focus and reframe perceptions. Here is why and how it works.** 

The way most organisations set targets for diversity pose a challenge and can become an unintended barrier to achieve diversity. It's because we tend to focus on the minorities and gender equality. Often, the connotations of targets, such as 30 % women in leadership, often trigger associations to  “nice to have” and unconscious perceptions that diversity is a “women’s issue”, thus the solution must be to fix the women. Such diversity targets can also result in resistance
because of the misconception that women are to be hired or promoted because they are women and not because they are competent. 

**We need to change these misperceptions and create an understanding that diverse and gender-balanced teams are a resource and that the purpose is to hired and promote the best qualified.** 

**This should be done without mentioning 'diversity', 'gender', and 'women'.**



**Here is an example of how to do that:**

**! Make sure you customise the target based on your internal data about your pipeline.**



**How it worked**

The performance diversity measures behind the ‘max 70 % principle’ relates to teams only (when there is direct collaboration amongst the group members in question). Research shows that when the prevalence of demographic factors, such as gender, generation, and nationality, are
set at a maximum of 70 % on a team, then the performance is better. The profit margin is on average 3.7 % higher in diverse teams versus more homogeneous teams and than in teams with a higher prevalence of the above factors.


By changing targets for the representation of demographic diversity in teams and the perception about inclusion and diversity in Arla Foods, the conversation changed to be predominantly resource and performance oriented. This discourse change was driven by those who had participated in the inclusion and diversity (this was not the title) learning session (which was a bottom-up change movement). There was minimal resistance from leaders. On the contrary, the leaders expressed their explicit support for such target setting because it resonated with performance and innovation. One leader created a tool spreadsheet to measure the composition of the current team and used this to make a fact-based and informed selection in hiring situations. The leader shared this tool with the human resource department and they shared it across the organisation.

Leaders in Arla Foods use the objective as a guiding principle in recruitment, restructuring of teams, staffing project teams, and composing work groups.
And none of the leaders were being held accountable or forced to reach this
goal. Instead, they worked on achieving it because it made sense for them,
and that’s why the reframing worked so successfully. They reported positive
group dynamics and better performance in the diverse teams.

This design has since been used by many other organisations and team leaders.

**It's a really powerful way to motivate and engage all people in achieving better balance, more diversity and high performance teams by using data and setting targets**
