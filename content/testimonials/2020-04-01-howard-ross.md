  Tinna Nielsen and Lisa Kepinski have grabbed the tiger by the tail with their excellent work on Inclusion Nudges. By doing exhaustive research on not only what can work, but also what is actually working, they have put together a powerful toolkit that not only helps people discover behaviors that can encourage a more inclusive environment, but also shapes our thinking in ways that help us learn to find new solutions ourselves. This is an important book for anyone who wants to create real, sustainable change in their organization.
