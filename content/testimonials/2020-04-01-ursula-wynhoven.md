  One of my favourite aspects of the Inclusion Nudges Guidebook is the 100+ concrete examples it presents that have been proven to lead people willingly toward more inclusive behaviour. These really do work. As such, the Guidebook is an evidence-based powerful tool to inspire the use of these and other nudges to make sustainable change in organisations and communities.
