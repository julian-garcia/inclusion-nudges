  I highly recommend using Inclusion Nudges. In addition to the obvious uses of these many excellent nudges, I also find that reading them all sparks my creativity. Each time I need to design an intervention, I pick up the book & just skim through it. Sometimes, I find a nudge I can use exactly as written & other times I just get inspired and think of a special twist to it or create a new one.
